Testing Dataset with BEST within 24h Logic
==================================================

PROFIT TARGET CALCULATION:
------------------------------
Method: BEST reverse signal within 288 bars (~24 hours)
Logic:
  - BUY signals: Find SELL with HIGHEST price in window
  - SELL signals: Find BUY with LOWEST price in window
  - Fallback: Uses next reverse if no signal in window

ADVANTAGES over 'Next Reverse' method:
------------------------------
1. Captures MAXIMUM profit potential within timeframe
2. More realistic (traders wait for best exit, not just first)
3. Aligned with actual trading behavior
4. Still time-constrained (24h) to avoid overfitting
