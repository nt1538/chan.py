Testing Dataset with Sliding Window
==================================================

SLIDING WINDOW CONFIGURATION:
------------------------------
Window Size: 1000 K-lines
Final Window Position: idx 22711
Total BSP Collected: 5454

BENEFITS:
------------------------------
1. Memory Efficient: Only fixed K-lines in RAM
2. Faster: Smaller Chan system to recalculate
3. Complete: All BSP preserved (even from slid-out data)
4. Scalable: Can process years of data

DATASET CHARACTERISTICS:
------------------------------
This dataset is IDENTICAL to non-sliding version.
Same features, same structure, same compatibility.
The only difference is HOW it was generated (more efficiently).

USAGE:
------------------------------
1. Contains BOTH mature and immature BS points
2. Features match training dataset (no future data leak)
3. profit_target_pct is ground truth for testing
4. Filter has_profit_target==1 for valid test samples
5. snapshot_first_seen shows when point first appeared

CONFIGURATION:
------------------------------
Ticker: ^GSPC
Period: 2024-01-01 to 2024-05-01
Level: K_5M
Window Size: 1000 K-lines
Total Samples: 5454
Samples with Targets: 5422
